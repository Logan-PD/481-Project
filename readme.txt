STEP 0: Running and accessing the server
- Run the Blazor server through dotnet (through the commands 'dotnet build' and 'dotnet watch')
- Enter the host server url into a browser on a 1080p monitor (most likely localhost:[PORT NUMBER])

PART A: Login
- Once at the login page, you will see two text fields and two buttons. The text field for Username and Password can be entered, and login will redirect you to the homepage.
- The "Create Account" button will redirect you to account creation. In the e-mail text field, type "alice.smith@gmail.com", in the username text field, type "Alice Smith", and the password "123456".
    - This account has pre-made images and collections for testing purposes.
- Once that is done, click "Create Account" to be redirected back to the main login screen.
- In the Username textfield, type "Alice Smith" and in the password text field, type "123456".
- You will then be logged into the home page.
